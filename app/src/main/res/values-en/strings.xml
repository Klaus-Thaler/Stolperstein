    <string name="demnig_wuchs_in_nauen_und_berlin_"><![CDATA[Demnig grew up in Nauen and Berlin.         In 1967, he graduated from high school and began studying art education at the         Academy of Fine Arts in Berlin under Herbert Kaufmann. This was followed in 1969/1970 by a year         Industrial Design programme at the same university. From 1971, he continued his art education studies         at the Kunsthochschule Kassel and passed his first state examination there in 1974.         In the same year, Demnig began studying art at the University of Kassel under Harry Kramer,         followed by two years of work in the planning, construction management and realisation of monument renovations.         From 1980 to 1985, Demnig was an artistic-scientific assistant in the Department of Art at the University of Kassel.         at the University of Kassel.]]></string>
    <string name="_1985_er_ffnete_demnig_ein_eigenes_Atelier_"><![CDATA[In 1985 Demnig opened his own studio in         studio in Cologne and worked on several projects, including the Moltkerei workshop and the Fuhrwerkswaage art space.         Since 1994, he has also worked at the IGNIS cultural centre.\nSince April 2011         Demnig\'s studio in Frechen was located in the Signalwerk art centre, which was built on the site of the         former station of the Cologne-Frechen-Benzelrath railway. This is also where around         20 other artists known in the region also have their studios there. In 2017, he moved his studio         to Elbenrod in Hesse.]]></string>
    <string name="bekannt_wurde_demnig_durch_die_Herstellung_"><![CDATA[Demnig became known for         for his Stumbling Stones, which he also lays himself. They are intended to commemorate people         who fell victim to the Nazi dictatorship. The stones, which have small brass plates on the top         with the names of the victims, are laid in the pavement in front of their former homes.         pavement.\n         Launched in 1996 and realised in 1,200 German municipalities by 2017, the project has been         the largest decentralised memorial in the world and now counts 100,000 stones in 31         European countries (2023). The copyright for the Stolpersteine in the broadest sense lies         lies solely and exclusively with Gunter Demnig himself.\n         A copyright actually created by Demnig         must, however, be questioned in this respect: he was aware of the project         Names & Stones, which was started in 1994 by Tom Fecht for the first AIDS victims in the pavements         in Bonn, Hamburg and Berlin (Invalidenstraße, in front of the Natural History Museum).\n         The names of the victims were and are chiselled into small square natural stones. However,          Demnig can claim to have honoured the victims after modifying the         form (stones with brass plate) and with new content (e.g. dates of life), Demnig can claim to have honoured the         Holocaust victims throughout Germany and later worldwide.\n]]></string>
